# Here's a Flag
## Description
```
A quick teaser to get yourself ready for the challenges to come! Just look for/at the flag and perhaps try your hand at some frontend tomfoolery? very.uniquename.xyz:2086
```
After using inspect on the web page I fount the following statements
```
caesar-cipher: +3;
flag: "gvf{zh0frph_wr_ghfrqvwuxfwi}";
```
After decrypting the caesar-cipher I found the the flag as:
```
dsc{we0come_to_deconstructf}
