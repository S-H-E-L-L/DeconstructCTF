# The Conspiracy
Here in this challenge we were given a text file and instruction as follows:
```
There was once a sailor who travelled to many countries. 
He was a quirky old man. He said many many things,and most of what he said never made sense to anyone. 
He considered himself ahead of his time, and said that the people of his time were unworthy of his wisdom. 
Soon he was lost to the ages, but his diary wasnâ€™t.
Are you worthy of decoding his wisdom? 
```
diary.txt :
```

So it's clearly seen that the text is Base64 encoded after decoding the text from online Base64 decoder i got the results as follows:
``` 
dsc{(-18.05572729282756, 178.45700143131674),(19.028282857505392, 103.14426071207107),(42.536705991266146, 1.4930344612276933),(38.5893697217354, 68.81632523058967),_,(50.851518948206795, 4.360180853581986),(7.671863538453386, 36.83726095698952),_,(38.619506740587035, 34.85512642711004),(47.42806157123545, 18.998421101903602),(30.19387158353921, 31.12496611612573),_,(-0.23177559426111558, -78.5033963083949),(-12.85446936733455, 132.79262433883298),(44.424231252577435, 24.350241166279226),(24.8195647413923, 120.97236754005058),(18.584456974403487, -72.31812189614772)}
```
After searching for each coordinate on google and taking the first letter of the country.

For example:- The coordinate (-18.05572729282756, 178.45700143131674) is Naitasiri District, Fiji so i took letter F as the first letter of the flag and i obtained the flag as:
``` 
dsc{FLAT_BE_THE_EARTH}
```
